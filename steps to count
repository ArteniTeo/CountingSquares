# Convert to grayscale
# Apply GaussianBlur to reduce noise
# Edge detection (Canny or alternative thresholding)
# Find contours
# Loop through contours and filter for squares
# Approximate the contour
# Check if it has 4 vertices, is convex, and has area above a threshold
# Get side lengths to ensure theyâ€™re roughly equal
# Draw the contour on the image
